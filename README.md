visualize 3d bounding box with discrete points
I share a code to visualize 3d bounding boxes. In specific, this code generates discrete points alone the 3d bounding boxes and save these points as a .txt file. Then we can use the software CloudCompare to visualize the 3d bounding box that the code generated. A visualization example is shown below.<br>
